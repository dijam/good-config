# good-config

Easy to use centralized config with the goal of having config simple and extendable.

## Version 2.0.0 - Breaking changes
- Update dependencies
- remove S3 support

## Version 1.1.2
Update dependencies (#5)

## Version 1.1.1
Fixed the bug (#2) which ignores empty values to be set bia environmental variables.

## Version 1.1.0

Added envify functionality. It means you can now just define your config the way you want (json/yml). In run time, if you needed to overwrite a key, just follow Uppercase+Underscore and you would be able to overwrite it.
For example you have a config like this:

```
{
  key1: "value1",
  key2: {
    subKey: 1,
    anotherKey: "changeme"
  }
}
```

Say you want to change `anotherKey` value via environmental variables. You can just set `KEY2_ANOTHERKEY` to the value you want and good-config will replace it with the correct value.

## Main features

- Supports for both `yaml` and `json`
- Possibility to add your own provider
- Hierarchical support thanks to [merge-config](https://github.com/telefonica/node-merge-config)
- Envify support: You can overwrite any config key via env variables and envify convert `parent.key` to `PARENT_KEY`

Currently it has these providers:

- FileSystem
- Feel free to make PR for other providers

## Installation

```bash
npm install good-config
```

## File structure

```
/myproduct
    default.json
    production/
        default.json
        euw.json
    staging/
        default.json
        euw.json
        use.json
```

## How to use

To get the config before starting the app, just wrap the server startup call in `app.js`.

```js
const Config = require("good-config");

const config = new Config({
  path: "media-service",
  format: "json", // Optional
});

config
  .load()
  .then(() => {
    app.listen(config.get("port"), function() {
      console.log("Express app listening on port " + config.get("port"));
    });
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log("Failed to load the config");
  });
```

## Synchronous loading

There is also the option of loading config from filesystem synchronously, by calling `config.loadSync()`. See [examples](/examples) folder.

## Available options

- `path` : Path to the config file.
- `format`: Format of config files - Default `json`
- `provider`: Name of the provider class, [`FileSystem`]
- `env`: Content of NODE_ENV, [`production`, `development`, ...]
